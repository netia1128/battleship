How do you know if a project is successful?
- If we pass (3)
How can we achieve that as a group?
- Keeping in mind the specs of the project
How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
- "Good job"
Any additional questions that you would like to add:

Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)
- We're working on the project
When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?
- Brant: baby is crying (solution is to turn on noise cancelling feature of headphones)
- Netia: Deal with the distracion and get back to work immediately
If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.)
- Brant: Tethering to phone for data or driving to father's house
- Netia: Go to Turing
Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?
- Take a break when we need to. Both parties are cool with this method.
Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?

# Project:Battleship

**Group Member Names:**
Netia Ingram & Brant Fuller

**Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):**
Brant: To learn how to work well as part of a team/group, and to learn how to look at a problem and figure out what classes/methods/variables are needed without being explicitly told.
Netia: To improve upon ability to breakdown a set of requirements and create a useful, tactical blueprint for how the team will meet those requirements. To improve hash skills.
Team: Our mutual, overarching goal is to excel on this project. The score we receive at the end of this effort will reflect if we succeeded in that goal or not.

**Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):**  
Brant's has a strong ability to look at a problem and intrinsically know which direction to take to solve it. He is very flexible, and can either work in a very planned format or he can work in a more spontaneous fashion.
Netia's best strength for this project is her lack of shame, which means she has no hesitation in asking for help or advice. She likes to plan quite a bit before starting a project.

**How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:**
We feel like our strengths mesh very well together. Brant's strength will assist us in getting the ball rolling on moving towards a solution, and when we get stuck, Netia's ability to reach out for help can kick in to get us unstuck.  

**Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):**  
Brant has a baby (Lawrence) that is awake from 6:00 AM to 6:30 PM MST. He would like to see his son everyday, at least for a little while. His wife also goes to bed at 9:30 MST, so it's best if our paired-coding sessions are over by then. Netia has scheduled meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons around 5:00. We both agree that it would be better to "front load" time spent on this project, so we will just plan each day to spend as much time as possible working on this project.  

**Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):**  
We will communicate via slack as often as needed. We both like brainstorming to arrive at decisions. We will talk through any issues that arise, including any related to emotional or mental well-being.  

**Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):**


**Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):**  
We will approach this in "ping pong" style, taking turns indiscriminately to develop different features.

**Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):**  
- We will do a new git commit for every test.
- We will do a new branch/pull request for each sizeable block of code (typically each method).
- We will be working on our code together, so we will work through issues together as they arise.

**Pomodoro Break Schedule:**
Neither of us work well with a Pomodoro schedule, so we will just take breaks as needed.

**Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:**
Brant always tries to be kind and polite when giving feedback. He likes any feedback he received to be constructive.
Netia is sometimes unintentionally blunt when giving feedback, but will try very hard to be cognizant of how what she is saying comes across rather than focusing on the intent. Netia like lots of feedback and doesn't care how it's given.

H3 Additional Remote Considerations:

**Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):**  
Github and Excel

**Day 1 Agenda:**
Complete DTR, create a project plan, and start coding.
