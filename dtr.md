Any additional questions that you would like to add:

Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)
- We're working on the project
When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?
- Brant: baby is crying (solution is to turn on noise cancelling feature of headphones)
- Netia: Deal with the distracion and get back to work immediately
If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.)
- Brant: Tethering to phone for data or driving to father's house
- Netia: Go to Turing
Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?
- Take a break when we need to. Both parties are cool with this method.
Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
